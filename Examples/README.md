:construction: **We are still working on getting these examples ready. Because we are doing this in our spare time, it may take us a few more weeks. The sources in the [NoModules](NoModules) directory are complete, though, so you can consult these (for most examples, the modular aspects are irrelevant anyway).**

# Examples

This directory contains all source code for the examples given 
in [*Beginning C++20*](https://www.apress.com/9781484258835) by Ivor Horton and Peter Van Weert (Apress, 2020).

Because at the time of writing compilers did not support C++20 modules yet,
we made all examples that are not explicitly about modules
available both with the use of modules and imports (the [Modules](Modules) directory),
and without the use of modules and imports (the [NoModules](NoModules) directory).
