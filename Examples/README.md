# Examples

This directory contains all source code for the examples given 
in [*Beginning C++20*](https://www.apress.com/9781484258835) by Ivor Horton and Peter Van Weert (Apress, 2020).

Because at the time of writing compilers did not support C++20 modules yet,
we made all examples available both with modules (the Modules directory) and without (the NoModules directory).

:construction: **We are still working on getting these examples ready. Because we are doing this in our spare time, it may take us a few more weeks, so please bear with us. For time being, you can consult the source code of the previous edition of the book at https://github.com/Apress/beg-cplusplus17**  :construction:
