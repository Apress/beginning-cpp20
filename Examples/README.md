# Examples

This directory contains all source code for the examples given 
in [*Beginning C++20*](https://www.apress.com/9781484258835) by Ivor Horton and Peter Van Weert (Apress, 2020).

The [Modules](Modules) directory contains all source code as discussed in the book.
If your compiler does not support C++20 modules yet
(which at the time of writing is likely),
you may be better off using the code in [NoModules](NoModules) instead, though.
This directory contains equivalents of all examples without the use of modules.

Consult the [Workarounds](../Workarounds) directory on 
how to work around compilation issues with other C++20 language and library features 
that your compiler may not (fully) [support](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support) yet.
