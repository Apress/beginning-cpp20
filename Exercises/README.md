# Exercise Solutions

This directory contains the solutions to all exercises of
[*Beginning C++20*](https://www.apress.com/9781484258835) by Ivor Horton and Peter Van Weert (Apress, 2020).

The [Modules](Modules) directory contains solutions that use C++20 modules.
If your compiler does not support C++20 modules yet, though
(which at the time of writing is likely),
you may be better off looking at the solutions in the [NoModules](NoModules) directory instead.

Consult the [Workarounds](../Workarounds) directory on 
how to work around compilation issues with other C++20 language and library features 
that your compiler may not (fully) [support](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support) yet.
